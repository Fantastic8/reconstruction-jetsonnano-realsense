# reconstruction-jetsonnano-realsense
This project is doing 3D reconstruction using Jetson nano and Intel realsense to capture images and reconstruct a mesh model on Google Cloud using openMVG and openMVS algorithm

# Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live syste.

#Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them.


#Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you have to get a development environment running.

Say what the step will be
