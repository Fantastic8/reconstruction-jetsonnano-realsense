# Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live syste.


# Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them.


# Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you have to get a development environment running.

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo.

# Running the tests

Explain how to run the automated tests for this system.

## Break down into end to end tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

# And coding style tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

# Deployment

Add additional notes about how to deploy this on a live system.
